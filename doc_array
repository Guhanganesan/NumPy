Arrays:

Object Essentials:-

NumPy provides two fundamental objects: an N-dimensional array object
(ndarray) and a universal function object (ufunc). 

An N-dimensional array is a homogeneous collection of “items” indexed using N
integers

There are two essential pieces of information that define an N-dimensional
array: 1) the shape of the array, and 2) the kind of item the array is composed of.

The shape of the array is a tuple of N integers (one for each dimension) that
provides information on how far the index can vary along that dimension.


Every ndarray is a homogeneous collection of exactly the
same data-type, every item takes up the same size block of memory, and each block
of memory in the array is interpreted in exactly the same way1
